## IXI-Clock

The watch was inspired by a Swatch Watch I found on the street. However the font of the Numbers were changed to Times New Roman to have a contrast to the modernist minimalistic design of the pointers.

## Enterprise-E

One of the first models I tried to create by tracing a Blueprint of the Enterprise-E. Overall I mostly spent time on the Warp drive and never really got the Enterprise to look like the Enterprise.

Thus the Ship is shrouded in Darkness simply to show off the Warp-Drive without showing the main Part of the ship.

## Dice

 Life is full of confusion. Confusion of love, passion, and romance. Confusion of family and friends. Confusion with life itself. What path we take, what turns we make. How we roll our dice.
