I checked out the [DelftX Course Delft Design Approach](https://www.edx.org/node/1829). The first assignment was to think about the design process and create a visualization. For my (ideal) design process you need four steps

1. Raw Materials (Research, Skills, Past Projects)
2. Create variations of the Product (Sketches)
3. Create the Product
4. Refine the Product and thus becoming again a potential raw material for anotherÂ product
