Looking back this is the last time I worked with Maya. Most of my time is needed to focus on my studies.

These last two Animations were short tests I needed to complete my portfolio for the course "Grundlagen der Gestaltung" at the University of Ulm.

The Animations are only Boxes so you can focus primarily on the Motion of the objects.
