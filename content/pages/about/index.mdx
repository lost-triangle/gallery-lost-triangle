# About
Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Neal Burger and I am a 3D artist and designer specializing in creating images using Autodesk Maya. 3D art and design is one of my hobbies, I also work as a lecturer at LMU (University of Munich) where I impart my knowledge and skills to the next generation of 3D artists.

I have been working with 3D art and design for several years and have a wide range of experience in creating images for architecture visualization, product visualization, and character design. My skills include modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering.

On this website, you will find a selection of my recent work, showcasing my ability to bring ideas to life in a visually stunning manner. I am constantly updating my portfolio with new projects, so please check back frequently to see my latest creations.

I am honored to share my knowledge and skills with students at LMU and I am always available to assist my students in their own projects.

If you have any questions or would like to work together, please feel free to contact me via email at info@nealbuerger.com. I would be happy to discuss any potential project ideas or answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for visiting my website.
